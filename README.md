# API Keys
* The project uses Google Maps for Android which requires an API key.
* The key is parsed using a `gmp.key` variable inside a [local.properties](local.properties) file defined in the project root - this file is ignored by git.
* Set this to match your own Google Maps API Key when building the project, e.g.:
* `gmp.key=ABCDEFG123`
